                    <h1>About me</h1>
                    <p>As you may know, my name is Xeraction and I like Minecraft. I like Minecraft so much that I want to modify it in whatever way possible. Datapacks, plugins, mods, etc.</p>
                    <p>I have a somewhat popular <a href="https://discord.gg/PH3JzYD">Discord Server</a> about datapacks where everyone can get help.</p>
                    <p>I also like to do small projects that come to my mind, like this website.</p>
					<p>That's pretty much all the info you get, so... go and read something else that is more enjoyable.
