                    <h1>MCCG</h1>
                    <p>The MCCG, or Minecraft Command Generator (it's an acronym) was made by me originally in C#.<br>But after I learned about the possibilities that Java gives you, I decided to port it over.</p>
                    <p>It is now rather dead, not active in development. You can still download it from its <a href="https://github.com/Xeraction/MCCommandGenerator">GitHub page</a>, but I don't encourage you to.</p>
                    <p>If you want to know if and when I continue to work on the MCCG, you can join my <a href="https://discord.gg/PH3JzYD">Discord Server</a>. (only if you want)<br>Its main purpose is for Minecraft Datapacks, but you can still join. <small>(you probably came from there because there's no other reason you would know this exists)</small></p>
