                    <p>I have been very busy making a new quiz! This one's called "Name the Biome".<br>I think you know what you have to do there.</p>
                    <p>Because this quiz is a bit difficult, I added hints to all quizzes!<br>You can now see the word count, the letter count, and even see a letter of the word!<br>But only if you want to, of course.</p>
                    <p>With this new quiz came many internal changes, like dynamic level placement and other optimizations.<br>Have a look at the GitHub page if you're interested.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>10/25/2021</h1>
                    <p>Look at this! A new page has emerged from the depths of this website.<br>It will bring the newest news right to your eyes.<br>Isn't that wonderful?</p>
                    <p>This news is just to inform you about the existence of the news page.<br>When new, interesting (ok maybe not interesting) news are coming, they will be stacked on top of this news.</p>
                    <p>Understood? Yeah, me neither. You'll see it when there are new news.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
