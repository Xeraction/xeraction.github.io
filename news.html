                    <p>Website redesign!</p>
                    <p>I spent many hours of hard work getting this thing to look a little bit better.<br>I don't really know if I managed to do it tho, but I hope it is.</p>
                    <p>This time I went with fewer, not very saturated colors and gradients. (woo, technology)<br>The buttons got a redesign too to match with the rest.</p>
                    <p>Why did I do this? Because I plan on adding something new and big in a few months?<br>Of course not.</p>
                    <p>This is now the third design change and also the most major one.<br>Let's hope the fourth iteration looks even better, if it should arrive.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>

                    <h1>8/17/2022</h1>
                    <p>It's been 6 months! Where have you been?</p>
                    <p>Okay, I've been gone for quite a while. Not that anyone would notice. But I've been working on things in the background.</p>
                    <p>First off, I began work on a project for this website.<br>It would have been a site where you could upload your Minecraft player save file and it would show you everything that's saved within.<br>But in the end, after putting quite a bit of work into it, I decided that it was dumb and deleted everything.</p>
                    <p>Then I've kind of just sat idle doing nothing really.<br>Well, I did... something, but it's still too soon to talk about that. Maybe it will never even see the light of day.<br>Who knows.</p>
                    <p>But for a long time now, I wanted to do something. Not just for myself.<br>But I never quite got the motivation to do so.<br>I hope this will change very, very soon.</p>
                    <p>I have ideas, visions of projects that could be great if I would just find the motivation to complete them.<br>Many of those are sitting on my hard drive, uncompleted and abandoned.<br>I made them in times where I was less experienced and today I would have done so many things different.<br>That makes it very difficult to come back to them.</p>
                    <p>I also feel like some projects need an entire overhaul.<br>Especially the quiz site here is something I'm not happy with.<br>But can I find the motivation to make that happen?<br>How would I even go about it?<br>Should I just... remove it entirely?</p>
                    <p>No. I can't just delete things I don't like.<br>Either I change it until it's good or it stays bad.<br><i>But Xeraction, didn't you delete your latest project because you didn't like it?</i><br>No no, you didn't understand it right. It wasn't finished, so I can delete it at any time.</p>
                    <p>What am I doing.<br>I bind myself to my own rules and am afraid of breaking them.<br>What a misery.</p>
                    <p>See you, probably.</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>2/15/2022</h1>
                    <p>I'm back with another project!<br>This time, it's Conways Game of Life.</p>
                    <p>I added a few extras, such as saving in three save slots or to a string that you can load anytime you want.<br>There are multiple draw modes and a button that fills the board random.</p>
                    <p>That's it pretty much.<br>I might be silent again for a few months before I return with something such as amazing as this!</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>2/5/2022</h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
                    <p>Today I come with an announcement for a special project I have been working on:<br>Lettercode!</p>
                    <p>It is an <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esolang</a> with a very special syntax.<br>Every keywork is a letter!<br>But you can read about how it works on its page.</p>
                    <p>Just remember that it isn't bug free and you may encounter some messed up stuff.<br>To get that fixed, just <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.<br>I will fix the issue eventually.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>1/6/2022</h1>
                    <p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
                    <p>Seems like I completely forgot to mention the addition of the 42 game, so here you go.</p>
                    <p>OMG, I JUST added a BRAND NEW game to the site!<br>It's called... 42!!!!!!!</p>
                    <p>There you got your dramatic announcement.</p>
                    <p>Also removed the disclaimer from the biome quiz, because...<br>yeah, 1.18 is out, so...<br>This website really needs some attention.<br>I will probably add new stuff in the future.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>11/12/2021</h1>
                    <p>I have been very busy making a new quiz! This one's called "Name the Biome".<br>I think you know what you have to do there.</p>
                    <p>Because this quiz is a bit difficult, I added hints to all quizzes!<br>You can now see the word count, the letter count, and even see a letter of the word!<br>But only if you want to, of course.</p>
                    <p>With this new quiz came many internal changes, like dynamic level placement and other optimizations.<br>Have a look at the GitHub page if you're interested.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>10/25/2021</h1>
                    <p>Look at this! A new page has emerged from the depths of this website.<br>It will bring the newest news right to your eyes.<br>Isn't that wonderful?</p>
                    <p>This news is just to inform you about the existence of the news page.<br>When new, interesting (ok maybe not interesting) news are coming, they will be stacked on top of this news.</p>
                    <p>Understood? Yeah, me neither. You'll see it when there are new news.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
