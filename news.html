                    <p>I'm back with another project!<br>This time, it's Conways Game of Life.</p>
                    <p>I added a few extras, such as saving in three save slots or to a string that you can load anytime you want.<br>There are multiple draw modes and a button that fills the board random.</p>
                    <p>That's it pretty much.<br>I might be silent again for a few months before I return with something such as amazing as this!</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>

                    <h1>2/5/2022</h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
                    <p>Today I come with an announcement for a special project I have been working on:<br>Lettercode!</p>
                    <p>It is an <a href="https://esolangs.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">esolang</a> with a very special syntax.<br>Every keywork is a letter!<br>But you can read about how it works on its page.</p>
                    <p>Just remember that it isn't bug free and you may encounter some messed up stuff.<br>To get that fixed, just <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me.<br>I will fix the issue eventually.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>1/6/2022</h1>
                    <p>Happy new year everyone!</p>
                    <p>Seems like I completely forgot to mention the addition of the 42 game, so here you go.</p>
                    <p>OMG, I JUST added a BRAND NEW game to the site!<br>It's called... 42!!!!!!!</p>
                    <p>There you got your dramatic announcement.</p>
                    <p>Also removed the disclaimer from the biome quiz, because...<br>yeah, 1.18 is out, so...<br>This website really needs some attention.<br>I will probably add new stuff in the future.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>11/12/2021</h1>
                    <p>I have been very busy making a new quiz! This one's called "Name the Biome".<br>I think you know what you have to do there.</p>
                    <p>Because this quiz is a bit difficult, I added hints to all quizzes!<br>You can now see the word count, the letter count, and even see a letter of the word!<br>But only if you want to, of course.</p>
                    <p>With this new quiz came many internal changes, like dynamic level placement and other optimizations.<br>Have a look at the GitHub page if you're interested.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
                    <h1>10/25/2021</h1>
                    <p>Look at this! A new page has emerged from the depths of this website.<br>It will bring the newest news right to your eyes.<br>Isn't that wonderful?</p>
                    <p>This news is just to inform you about the existence of the news page.<br>When new, interesting (ok maybe not interesting) news are coming, they will be stacked on top of this news.</p>
                    <p>Understood? Yeah, me neither. You'll see it when there are new news.</p>
                    <p>But until then, farewell!</p>
                    <p>~X</p>
